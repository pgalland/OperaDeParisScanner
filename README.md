Opera de Paris Scanner
======================

These programs use the [selenium library](http://www.seleniumhq.org/).

They both emulate a firefox browser and go throught the web site of [Opera de Paris](http://www.operadeparis.fr/) to find all tickets of either opera or ballet below a price limit.

For the programs to work you need to replace "YourUsername" and "YourPassword" in the code by your actual username and password on the Opera de Paris website.

The price limit is set at 31â‚¬, you can change it in the code by changing PRICE_LIMIT.
